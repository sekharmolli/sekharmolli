👋 Hi, I’m Chandra Molli

Senior Product Manager with 18+ years of experience across **AI, voice, enterprise platforms, and infrastructure**.  
I build **AI-powered, enterprise-grade products** by combining product strategy with deep understanding of **hardware, networking, security, and platform reliability**.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- Design AI-first products using LLMs, RAG, and human-in-the-loop systems
- Own end-to-end product thinking — from **hardware & network foundations** to customer-facing AI experiences
- Translate complex platform and infrastructure constraints into **clear product roadmaps**
- Focus on **AI safety, system reliability, performance, cost control, and trust**

My background spans telecom (IMS, VoIP, CCaaS), secure cloud platforms, and large-scale lab and testbed environments.

## 🏗️ Platforms, Infrastructure & Security (Unfair Advantage)
Before and alongside product management, I **designed and operated enterprise-grade lab and platform environments**, which strongly informs how I build scalable AI products today.

Experience includes:
- Designing and managing **20+ rack lab environments** (Dell & HP servers)
- End-to-end **network architecture design**:
  - Core internal network
  - Internal DMZ
  - SBC layer
  - External DMZ
- Routing, switching, VLANs, firewall segmentation, and secure access patterns
- Hardware lifecycle ownership: racking, patching, BIOS/firmware upgrades, capacity planning
- Preparing repeatable **testbeds for telecom, voice, and platform validation**
- Writing **Python and shell scripts** to automate setup, validation, and testing

This hands-on platform experience shapes how I design **AI systems that are realistic, secure, and production-ready**.
